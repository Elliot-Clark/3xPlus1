# Collatz Conjecture

This is a web app I made to calculate and display the values derived from any inputted interger under the Collatz conjecture.

 The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer <i>n</i>. Then each number is obtained from the previous number as follows: if the previous number is even, the next number is one half of the previous number. If the previous number is odd, the next number is 3 times the previous number plus 1. 
 
 The conjecture is that no matter what value of the initial n, the sequence will always reach 1.

## Install

1. cd into folder
2. npm install

## Use 

Simply input any positive integer (whole numbers over 0) into the input bar and hit Enter to run. The length and highest number in the sequence will be shown on the left. Click on the forward and back arrows to move up and down an extra long sequence.
